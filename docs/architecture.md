# HackerAPI's architecture

## Frameworks and libraries used

This whole application was built off of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)!

### Routing

We use [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) to help us with routing.

### Authentication library

We use a `LocalStrategy` within Passport.js to authenticate a login session. Given an active session, the user must have a token called `session` in their cookies which was given by the api in order to continue accessing the api.

For authorization, we decided to write a custom RBAC-esque strategy. Check below for specifics on how it works, and how to work with it, and how to use it when extending this project.

### Testing

We use [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) with [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) to test our routes and services.

## Authorization

Before you read this section, it's important to understand the difference between `Authentication` and `Authorization`. The first asks the question: _"Do we know who you are?"_ (i.e. are you logged in?), whereas the second asks the question: _"Do you have sufficient permissions to be making this request?"_.

We use a custom implementation for authorization, which relies heavily on the design of Role-based access control.

### Definitions

#### `Route`

A `Route`, which is a component of a `Role`, is defined by its uri path, its query parameters in the uri path, the HTTP verb used to access it, and and `_id`:

```json
{
    "uri": "/api/sponsor/",
    "requestType": "POST",
    "_id": "000000010000000000000000"
}
```

#### `Role`

A `Role` is a collection of `Routes`, and a unique name (such as `hacker`, or `sponsor`, or `my-custom-role`). This collection of `Routes` should approximately encapsulate the set of actions that a user of the api should be able to do. For example, a `Hacker` might want to have access to `GET /api/hacker/507f1f77bcf86cd799439011` (get their own information), or `POST /api/hacker/` (create their hacker document):

```json
{
    "Name": "sponsor",
    "routes": [{
        "uri": "/api/sponsor/",
        "requestType": "POST"
    }]
}
```

_Note here that the parameter `routes` is a list of `Route` objects described in the previous section._

##### In our code-base, we have a auto-generated list of `single roles` and a custom list of `user roles`

`single roles` are roles that give permissions for one specific URI and request type. Every route has a `single role`.

```json
{
    "_id": "000000010000000000000000",
    "name": "postAccount",
    "routes": [{
        "uri": "/api/account/",
        "requestType": "POST",
        "_id": "000000010000000000000000",
    }]
}
```

`user roles` are syntactically the same as custom roles that give permissions for a collection of URIs and request types. These are essentially collections of routes that a given user needs access to in order to properly function with the API.

```json
{
    "_id": "000000020000000000000000",
    "name": "Account",
    "routes": [{
            "uri": "/api/account/",
            "requestType": "POST",
            "_id": "000000010000000000000000",
        },
        {
            "uri": "/api/account/:SELF",
            "requestType": "GET",
            "_id": "000000030000000000000000",
        },
        // etc.
    ]
}
```

Note that for each route in the `user role`, you have access to the `single role` document's `_id`!

#### `RoleBinding`

A `RoleBinding` is a mapping between an `account` and a `Role`. In this way, we can say that an account has a certain set of allowed actions, defined by the `Role`. An `account` can have a `RoleBinding` to multiple `Roles`.

```json
{
    "accountId": "507f191e810c19729de860ea",
    "roles": ["54759eb3c090d83494e2d804", "51325eb3c090d83494e2d702"],
}
```

_note here that `roles` is a list of `ObjectIds`, since the role is also a document in the database._

### How to write a `Route` document

In order to encapsulate permissions based on the actual `params` of a given route (such as the resource id in `/api/hacker/507f1f77bcf86cd799439011`), we use two placeholders: `:self`, and `:all`. These two placeholders replace the location of the given parameter in the route; in the example above, we would translate the uri to either `/api/hacker/:self`, or `/api/hacker/:all`.

#### `:self`

The `self` placeholder provides the account that hits this `Route` access to only the resource that is related to this particular accountId. For example, if I wanted to hit `GET /api/hacker/507f1f77bcf86cd799439011`, then the hacker whose `id` was `507f1f77bcf86cd799439011` would have to have an `accountId` that is equal to the `id` of the account accessing this resource.

#### `:all`

The `all` placeholder provides the account that hits this `Route` access to any resource for a given id.

#### Chaining :self and :all

It is possible to chain `:self` and `:all` together if need-be. An example of chaining is either: `/:self/:all`, or `/:all/:all`, etc.

### Adding Authentication and Authorization to your middleware

We've tried to make this as simple and abstract as possible. To add `Authentication`, you just need to import the `Auth` module file, and then insert into the route definition:

```javascript
const Middleware = {
    Auth: require("../../middlewares/auth.middleware")
};
...
hackerRouter.route("/").post(
    Middleware.Auth.ensureAuthenticated(),
    // Whatever middleware is after this will run only if the user is authenticated.
);
```

To add `Authorization`, you will need to import the `Auth` module file, and then insert into the route definition, just like `Authentication`. However, if there are route parameters, you will need to also provide as arguments an array which contains the functions required to access the given parameters. The route parameters are typically some model id. The functions in the array need return an object that contains the user id either in `_id` or `accountId`. The method signature for the inputted functions must be: `(parameter) => {accountId:string} | {_id:string}`. There must be a one-to-one mapping between route parameters and function inputs. The order of route parameters and function inputs must be the same. The details of authorization is heavily commented in in `ensureAuthorized` at [auth.service.js](../services/auth.service.js). An example is below:

```javascript
const Middleware = {
    Auth: require("../../middlewares/auth.middleware")
};
const Services = {
    Hacker: require("../../services/hacker.service"),
}
...
// some made-up route that allows a hacker to 'friend' another hacker
hackerRouter.route("/:id1/friend/:id2/").get(
    Middleware.Auth.ensureAuthenticated(),
    Middleware.Auth.ensureAuthorized([Services.Hacker.findById, Services.Hacker.findById]),
    // Whatever middleware is after this will run only if the user is authenticated AND has sufficient permissions to access this route.
);
```

Here, we note that we pass in one function for `id1`, and one function for `id2`.

The `ensureAuthorized` middleware calls the `ensureAuthorized` service in [auth.service.js](../services/auth.service.js).

### Limitations

There are some limitations to this authorization method:

* You can only specify access to a related resource, or to all resources. As such, it is currently not possible to give a user access to some arbitrary set of resources. This might come in a later version of this authorization service.

## Searching

More complex searches on models are available on our API. We provide a subset of the mongoose query language that allows you to quickly get results for a given model. On our `search/` route, just assign `q` to your query in your query parameters.

### Structure of your query

The search query is strucutered as a series of param, operation, value objects (P.O.V.) passed into the `/search/:model` route:

```json
[
    {"param": "a", "operation":"...", "value":"..."},
    {"param": "b", "operation":"...", "value":"..."},
    {"param": "c", "operation":"...", "value":"..."},
    {"param": "d", "operation":"...", "value":"..."}
]
```

Where `param` is the parameter you want to search by (email, age, gender, etc.), `operation` is valid for the type you are conducting the search on:

| Type      | Operations                                         |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `String`  | `['equals', 'ne', 'regex', 'in']`                  |
| `Number`  | `['equals', 'ne', 'gte', 'lte', 'le', 'ge', 'in']` |
| `Boolean` | `['equals', 'ne']`                                 |

`value` is the value that you want to compare entries in the DB against.

An example query to find all hackers whose email ends with `@mail.mcgill.ca` would be:

```json
[{"param":"email", "operation":"regex", "value":".+@mail.mcgill.ca"}]
```

Sequential P.O.V.s are chained together using an `and` operator. There currently is no functionality for chaining them as `or`. To find all hackers whose email ends with `@mail.mcgill.ca` and were checked in, the query would be:

```json
[
    {"param":"email", "operation":"regex", "value":".+@mail.mcgill.ca"},
    {"param":"status", "operation":"equals", "value":"Checked-in"}
]
```

The http request that this would translate to is:

```http
/api/search/hacker?q=%5B%7B%22param%22%3A%22email%22%2C%20%22operation%22%3A%22regex%22%2C%20%22value%22%3A%22.%2B%40mail.mcgill.ca%22%7D%2C%7B%22param%22%3A%22status%22%2C%20%22operation%22%3A%22equals%22%2C%20%22value%22%3A%22Checked-in%22%7D%5D
```

### Error Codes and Messages

Error messages are in the error.constant.js file. The error constants are of the for TYPE_HTTPCODE_MESSAGE. For example, HACKER_404_MESSAGE. When creating a response, use an existing error message, or create a new one. An example:

```js
next({
    status: 422,
    message: Constants.Error.ACCOUNT_DUPLICATE_422_MESSAGE,
    error: {...}
});
```

Note that the error status and the HTTPCODE in the error constant name are the same.

Error codes currently in use are:
401 - Invalid authentication
403 - Invalid authorization
404 - Resource not found
409 - Conflict with Id or some attribute from a valid request.
422 - Failure at validation, or other forms of invalid input
500 - General server error
